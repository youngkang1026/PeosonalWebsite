				<p>I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student from <a href="http://statistics.columbia.edu">Department of Statistics</a> at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>. I am working with Professor <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jb2814/">Jose Blanchet </a>. I am intersted in Applied Probabilty, Machine Learning, Robust Statistics Method, Distributional Robust Optimization, Stochastic Analysis and Financial Network. Before coming to Columbia, I got my B.S. in Mathematics from School of Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) with highest honor (Guo-Moruo Scholarship).</p>
